# Security Risks

Attack Scenario | Treatment Plans / Ideas | Probability | Potential Impact | Response Classification & Status | Decision & Discussion Details
---|---|---|---|---|---
_Weak Github Password_<br /><br />The attacker uses a brute force attack to discover a username/password combination for Github. | <ul><li>[Require 2FA on All Accounts](https://help.github.com/en/articles/requiring-two-factor-authentication-in-your-organization)</li><li>MFA through github credentials and UCSB SSO.</ul> | High <br/><br/> <ul><li>It has already occurred at UCD. It has been [publicly reported in the wild](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9247961/recover-a-deleted-repository-github-issues).</li></ul> | Medium <br/><br/> <ul><li>Repository Deleted (Loss Scenario)</li><li> The repositories code could be updated with malicious code. If the repository is tied to an automated deployment pipeline there is a chance of the code being deployed to Prod before being detected. (I really need to find a percentage likelihood of this.)</li></ul> | Mitigate
_Github Credentials Exposed in Public Source Code_<br /><br />Loss of credentials through accidental check-in in a public repository. | <ul><li>Scan source control before check-in (ie. [git-secrets](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets))</li></ul> | Medium <br /><br /> <ul><li></li></ul> |  | Mitigate | Would there be a case where both Github credentials and UCSB credentials would both be in source control? (Then again, why would either be in source control?)
_Github API Credentials Exposed in Public Source Code_<br /><br />Loss of credentials which would give an attacker access to Github API through accidental check-in in a public repository. | <ul><li>Scan source control before check-in (ie. [git-secrets](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets))</li></ul> | Medium <br /><br /> <ul><li>It wasn't Github API credential loss, but [this has already happened at UCSB](http://stevenmaglio.blogspot.com/2019/02/aws-api-key-exposed-in-github.html).</li><li>When possible, use [read-only API keys (deploy keys)](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/).</ul> | Medium <br/><br/> <ul><li>Repository Deleted (Loss Scenario)</li></ul> | Mitigate |


Loss Scenario | Recovery Plans / Ideas | Probability | Response Classification & Status | Decisiosn & Discussion Details
---|---|---|---|---
_Repository Deleted <br/>All Repositories Deleted_ <br /><br /> Repositories could be completely wiped out. | <ul><li>[An email to Github support](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9247961/recover-a-deleted-repository-github-issues) could get the repository recovered.</li><li>[Make a backup](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5578270/fully-backup-a-git-repo) on a schedule or as a part of the check-in process.</li><li>Multiple Origins</li></ul> |  |  |
_Repository Updated with Malicious Code_ <br /><br /> The repositories code could be updated with malicious code. If the repository is tied to an automated deployment pipeline there is a chance of the code being deployed to Prod before being detected. (I really need to find a percentage likelihood of this.) |  |  |  |  |
